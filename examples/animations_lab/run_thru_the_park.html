 * TODO:
 * Put an animation together of a stickperson running through a park.
 * - Build a viewport around the animation.
 * - Have the sky lighten and darken in a repeating day and night cycle.
 * - Have the moon and sun rotate around the sky.
 * - Have the sidewalk run in one direction forever at the bottom of the
 *   screen.
 * - Use a small amount of JavaScript to effect the runner sprite so that it
 *   looks like he is running on the sidewalk.

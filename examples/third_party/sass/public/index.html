                <p>
                    Some say it's a bookstore. Some call it a music shop, while others think of it as a great place to meet and relax. Books &amp; Beyond has become a unique phenomenon that offers this area's largest selection of sale books and music, with an inventory of CDs and tapes ranging from classical to independent-label rock and everything in between.

                    What makes us different is our atmosphere. We encourage you to relax with a book in one of our quiet rooms, or take some reading material into our Coffee and Juice Bar to read while snacking. Think of Books &amp; Beyond as your own den.

                <h1>Why go to any other book store?</h1>
                <p>
                    Need some quiet time away from your home or office? Need to put the speed and chaos of modern life in the backseat for a while? Sometimes, a little solitude buried in the pages of a good book is all you'll need. Visit with a friend over a super large double cappuccino or a fruit smoothie. Take a break from the everyday routine and pick up one of our award-winning desserts. You can do all these things at Books &amp; Beyond.

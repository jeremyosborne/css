# Lab - Layout

* Without setting box-sizing:
    * Turn the .floating-columns block into a two column layout that uses floats. Fix the general side effects that result from floats.
    * Turn the .inline-block-columns into a two column layout that use inline-block layout. Fix the general side effects that result from inline-block based layouts.
* Use a universal box sizing to make the arithmetic easier to do a 2 column layout.

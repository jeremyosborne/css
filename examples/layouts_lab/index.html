                    Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance
                    of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely
                    for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various
                    rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very
                    moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said
                    of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all
                    in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a
                    councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility
                    of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of
                    his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty,
                    in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in
                    parliamentary families.

                    In spite of this marriage, however, it was said
                    that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed,
                    though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the
                    whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and
                    to gallantry.

                    The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the
                    parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed.
                    M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the
                    Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she
                    had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate
                    of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall
                    of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps,
                    even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance,
                    with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of
                    renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of
                    these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly
                    smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes
                    overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes
                    would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one
                    could have told: all that was known was, that when he returned from
                    Italy he was a priest.

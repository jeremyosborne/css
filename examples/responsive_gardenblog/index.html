                        More than love, seeds need warmth, dirt, water, and eventually light.

                        Starting a garden is simple. Grab a pack of seeds. Grab some dirt. Grab some plastic pots. Place dirt in pots. Poke a hole in dirt. Place seed in whole. Cover seed. Wait. Water. Wait. Water. Wait. Water. Keep warm. Eventually you have seedlings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the seedlings are going, they likely still need warmth, and now need some regular light. But don't take them outdoors too quickly. A cold snap, or wind, could wipe out all of your seedlings in the matter of minutes. Not to mention a hungry bird might fancy itself a snack of your toil and effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping the seedlings indoors but near a light and warmth source is a good plan. If you don't have a good window, or you just don't want the seedlings indoors, try a greenhouse. Vintage greenhouses are wonderful, but today there are cost and time affordable tent like greenhouses. Easy to setup, easy to take down, no problem.

                        In no time at all, with a little luck and love&mdash;love is important during the inevitable trying times of plant parenthood&mdash;we'll have some wonderful plants. Some plants can be enjoyed immediately: greens eaten throughout the growing season; flowers enjoyed for aesthetics.

                        Days, weeks, sometimes months later we begin to enjoy the fruits, and vegatables, of our labor. Good garden plants often offer more than one way to enjoy them.

                        These beets, which grew did not produce good roots, produced tasty leaves. Chopping leaves and beet into a giant stir fry was tasty. Even garden failures mixed with some kitchen creativity can satisfy a tummy.
